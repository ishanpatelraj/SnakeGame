## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

| Concept         | Description                                            | File(s) Involved         |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| *Encapsulation* | Wrapping of snake, food, and game logic in classes | Snake.h/cpp, Food.h/cpp, Game.h/cpp |
| *Abstraction*   | Hiding implementation details of movement and logic | Same as above            |
| *Inheritance*   | (If applicable in extended versions)                | (Not used in current basic version) |
| *Polymorphism*  | Operator overloading in Point class      | Point.h/cpp        |
